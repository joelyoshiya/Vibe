# SpotiVibez
A platform for checking the "vibability" between two Spotify users. A.ka., their chemistry in terms of music taste. Pairs are given a "Vibe-rating" to determine their compatibility. 

This will be a web based application, utilizing the Spotify API. Current candidates for our Tech stack are the MERN stack or a python-based web framework like Django.
