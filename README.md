# SpotiVibes
A platform for checking the "vibability" between two Spotify users. a.ka., their chemistry in terms of music taste. Pairs are given a "Vibe-rating" to determine their compatibility. 

This will be a web based application, utilizing the Spotify API. Currently planning to implement with React/MERN Stack. 

Inspired by [obscurify](obscurifymusic.com) and [musictaste](musictaste.space)
